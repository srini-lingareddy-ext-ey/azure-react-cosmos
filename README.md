# React Web App with C# API and Cosmos DB for NoSQL on Azure

A minimal scaffold for getting a React web app with a C# API and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL running on Azure. Add your own application code and use the included Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) to provision and deploy.

Let's jump in and get this up and running in Azure. When you are finished, you will have a web app deployed to the cloud. In later steps, you'll see how to set up a pipeline and monitor the application.

### Prerequisites
> This template will create infrastructure and deploy code to Azure. If you don't have an Azure Subscription, you can sign up for a [free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Make sure you have contributor role to the Azure subscription.


The following prerequisites are required to use this application. Please ensure that you have them all installed locally.

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) - for the API backend
- [Node.js with npm (18.17.1+)](https://nodejs.org/) - for the Web frontend

### Quickstart
To learn how to get started with any template, follow the steps in [this quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/get-started?tabs=localinstall&pivots=programming-language-csharp) with this template (`Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-cosmos-sql`).

This quickstart will show you how to authenticate on Azure, initialize using a template, provision infrastructure and deploy code on Azure via the following commands:

```bash
# Log in to azd. Only required once per-install.
azd auth login

# First-time project setup. Initialize a project in the current directory, using this template.
azd init --template Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-cosmos-sql

# Provision and deploy to Azure
azd up
```

### Application Architecture

This template utilizes the following Azure resources:

- [**Azure App Services**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) to host the Web frontend and API backend
- [**Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-cosmos-db-core-api/) for storage
- [**Azure Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/) for monitoring and logging
- [**Azure Key Vault**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) for securing secrets

Here's a high level architecture diagram that illustrates these components. Notice that these are all contained within a single [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal), that will be created for you when you create the resources.

### Cost of provisioning and deploying this template
This template provisions resources to an Azure subscription that you will select upon provisioning them. Refer to the [Pricing calculator for Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate the cost you might incur when this template is running on Azure and, if needed, update the included Azure resource definitions found in `infra/main.bicep` to suit your needs.

### Application Code

This template is structured to follow the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/overview). You can learn more about `azd` architecture in [the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible?pivots=azd-create#understand-the-azd-architecture).

### Developer setup: pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit hooks catch quality issues before you push (FastLocal backend tests, frontend typecheck and ESLint). Uses native Git hooks only (no Husky). From the repo root:

- **Quick start:** `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh` (Windows: `scripts\install-hooks.cmd`)

See [docs/pre-commit-hooks.md](docs/pre-commit-hooks.md) for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

### Next Steps

At this point, you have an application deployed on Azure. But there is much more that the Azure Developer CLI can do. These next steps will introduce you to additional commands that will make creating applications on Azure much easier. Using the Azure Developer CLI, you can setup your pipelines, monitor your application, test and debug locally.

> Note: Needs to manually install [setup-azd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azd) for Azure DevOps (azdo).

- [`azd pipeline config`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/configure-devops-pipeline?tabs=GitHub) - to configure a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps) to deploy your application whenever code is pushed to the main branch.

- [`azd monitor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/monitor-your-app) - to monitor the application and quickly navigate to the various Application Insights dashboards (e.g. overview, live metrics, logs)

- [Run and Debug Locally](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/debug?pivots=ide-vs-code) - using Visual Studio Code and the Azure Developer CLI extension

- [`azd down`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-down) - to delete all the Azure resources created with this template

- [Enable optional features, like APIM](./OPTIONAL_FEATURES.md) - for enhanced backend API protection and observability

### Additional `azd` commands

The Azure Developer CLI includes many other commands to help with your Azure development experience. You can view these commands at the terminal by running `azd help`. You can also view the full list of commands on our [Azure Developer CLI command](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/ref) page.


## Security

### Roles

This template creates a [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for your app inside your Azure Active Directory tenant, and it is used to authenticate your app with Azure and other services that support Azure AD authentication like Cosmos DB and Key Vault via access policies and role assignments. You will see principalId referenced in the infrastructure as code files, that refers to the id of the currently logged in Azure Developer CLI user, which will be granted access policies and permissions to run the application locally. To view your managed identity in the Azure Portal, follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-view-managed-identity-service-principal-portal).

### Key Vault and secrets management

This template uses [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) for secrets in deployed environments. The API uses **managed identity** to read secrets from Key Vault at runtime (no connection strings or keys in app settings or code). For **local development**, use [dotnet user-secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) so sensitive values stay off the repo. No secrets are stored in `appsettings.json` or committed to source control. See [docs/secrets-management.md](docs/secrets-management.md) for patterns, user-secrets usage, and Key Vault soft-delete/purge-protection recommendations.

### Web app: Microsoft Entra (MSAL)

Without **`VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID`**, the web app runs in **local development mode only**: no Entra sign-in, **no tokens**, **no `Authorization` headers** on API calls, and the UI shows **AUTH DISABLED** so this is not mistaken for real authentication. Set `VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID` (and scopes as needed) for real sign-in. For **Azure deployments**, supply those `VITE_MSAL_*` values at **build** time (`azd env set …` before `azd deploy`, or GitHub **Variables** / Azure Pipelines variables—see the **Deploying to Azure** section in [docs/auth-msal.md](docs/auth-msal.md)).

Details: [docs/auth-msal.md](docs/auth-msal.md) · [docs/api-client.md](docs/api-client.md) · `src/web/.env.example`. Server state: [docs/tanstack-query.md](docs/tanstack-query.md).
